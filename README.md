A simple snake game with A.I. that plays on its own.

There are no graphics in the game. The picture is printed frame by frame as text.
If the update time is too fast, or if the size of the board is too big for the terminal, it might look odd.

All you need is python 3 to run this.
To launch the game just run the main.py script.
Enter the size of the board (integer). If you give a 10 for example, the board will be 10x10 and so on.
Enter the update time (integer or float) in seconds. This is the time between each 'frame'.
Again, if this is too fast or if the size is too big, the game might look odd. Adjust for best performance :)

Thats pretty much it.
The A.I. is pretty dumb at this moment, so don't expect too much entertainment.
